Helper scripts for numerical methods

Currently, the only way to use the script is to modify the main section of
methods.py or to make another script which consumes it. This may also require
the creation of Python functions representing the real-life functions
being approximated using the specified numerical methods. Sample code is
included in methods.py demonstrating the usage of the bisection method
for a cubic function.

Current methods:

* Bisection Method
* Newton-Raphson Method
